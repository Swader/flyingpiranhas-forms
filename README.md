####Contributing
There's a lot of @todos in the code, so feel free to take a look and submit a pull request if you fix anything. Also, we desperately need tests written. There's a few of them to serve as an example in the tests/ subfolder, so if you could contribute that'd be swell. There is only one rule: follow PSR-2 as much as possible. Use other classes as examples and keep the coding style consistent.
